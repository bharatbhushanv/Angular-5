# Angular-5
Angular 5 is a JavaScript framework that makes it easy to build web applications and apps in JavaScript, html, and TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

Step 1. Set up the Development Environment 
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install Node.jsÂ® and npm if they are not already on your machine.

Step 2. Create a new project 

Open a terminal/command prompt window.

Generate a new project and default application by running the following command:
ng new applicationName

Step 3: Serve the application 

Go to the project directory and launch the server.
cd applicationName
ng serve --open
