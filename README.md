Step 1. Set up the Development Environment 

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.
Install Node.jsÂ® and npm if they are not already on your machine.

Then install the Angular CLI globally.
npm install -g @angular/cli

Step 2. Create a new project 

Open a terminal/command prompt window.

Generate a new project and default app by running the following command:

ng new my-app

Step 3: Serve the application 

Go to the project directory and launch the server.
cd my-app
ng serve --open
